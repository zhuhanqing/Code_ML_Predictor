# Code_ML_Predictor
This is a repo to store the code of HLS-level ML predictor

This project aims to establish a HLS-level prediction model for the Quality of Results(QoR): Resource Usage; Timing on FPGA ; We would extract important info from HLS tools, then establish a regression model, and predict value so as to control no more than 10% relative error value.
